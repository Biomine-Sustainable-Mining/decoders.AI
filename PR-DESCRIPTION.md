# LoRaWAN AI Driver Framework - Pull Request Description v1.1.0

## 🎯 Feature Addition: Complete AI-Generated LoRaWAN Driver Ecosystem

### Overview
Add comprehensive AI-powered LoRaWAN driver generation system to Tasmota with 12 production-ready drivers covering 182 sensor channels across major IoT vendors.

### What This PR Adds
- **AI Framework**: Complete driver generation system with Berry language compliance
- **12 Production Drivers**: Dragino (6) + Milesight (6) sensors with 100% channel coverage
- **182 Sensor Channels**: Full uplink/downlink implementation for all documented protocols
- **Auto-Generation**: Template-driven system for creating new drivers from PDF specifications
- **ESP32 Optimized**: Memory-efficient implementation under 600 bytes per decode

### Core Components

#### Framework Files
- `LwDecode.be` - Core framework (v2.2.8) with helper functions, formatters, downlink system
- `DEVELOPER-PROMPT.md` - AI generation template (v2.3.0) with validation patterns
- `emoji-reference.md` - UI emoji mappings for sensor types
- `BERRY-CUSTOM-LANGUAGE-REFERENCE.md` - Berry syntax compliance guide

#### Driver Implementation
**Dragino Sensors:**
- D2x (Multi-probe temperature) - 15 channels
- DDS75-LB (Distance sensor) - 8 channels  
- LDS02 (Door sensor) - 8 channels
- LHT52 (Temp/humidity with datalog) - 16 channels
- LHT65 (Multi-sensor with 9 external types) - 18 channels
- PS-LB (Pressure sensor) - 13 channels

**Milesight Sensors:**
- AM300 (Air quality monitor) - 20 channels
- WS101 (Smart button) - 8 channels
- WS202 (PIR & light sensor) - 9 channels
- WS301 (Door/window sensor) - 10 channels
- WS523 (Smart socket) - 33 channels
- WS52x (Socket series with power monitoring) - 25 channels

### Technical Features

#### AI Generation System
- PDF-to-driver conversion with protocol extraction
- MAP file caching for rapid regeneration
- Template-driven code generation with validation
- Automatic documentation and test scenario creation

#### Driver Architecture
- Global node storage with persistence across reloads
- Battery trend tracking and device reset detection
- Multi-device support per driver slot
- Complete error handling with try/catch patterns
- Memory optimization for ESP32 constraints

#### User Interface
- Emoji-first compact display format
- Dynamic multi-line layouts for complex sensors
- Real-time status indicators and trend data
- Age indicators for stale data detection

#### Command System
- Standardized `Lw[MODEL][Function]<slot>` command pattern
- Test commands with realistic payload scenarios
- Node management (statistics, data clearing)
- Complete downlink command coverage
