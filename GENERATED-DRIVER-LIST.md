# AI-Generated LoRaWAN Driver List

## Overview
This document maintains a comprehensive list of all AI-generated drivers for the LwDecode framework with version tracking and generation dates.

## Versioning Strategy
- v<major>.<minor>.<fix>
  - **major**: Increased only when official sensor specs change from vendor (starts at 1)
  - **minor**: Increased only when fresh regeneration is requested (resets to 0 on major change)
  - **fix**: Increased on all other cases (resets to 0 on minor change)
- All publish dates must be greater than 2025-08-13 (framework start date)
