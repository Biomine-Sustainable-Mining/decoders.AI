```

```
Update all drivers to use lwdecode.log_error() instead of print() for error reporting. Maintain same error context.
```

### Vendor-Wide Operations
```
Standardize all Milesight drivers to use consistent global storage pattern: [VENDOR]_[MODEL]_nodes with same node data structure.
```

```
Update all vendor/milesight/ drivers to template v2.1.9 requirements - Lw prefix, enhanced error handling, safe operations.
```

```

```
Standardize motion detection emojis across all PIR sensors - use üö∂ for motion detected, üö´ for no motion.
```

### Display Optimization
