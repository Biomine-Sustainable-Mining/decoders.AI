   - Try/catch error handling with display protection
   - Nil safety in all comparisons and operations
   - Keys() method safety (size() on map directly)
   - Data recovery after lwreload with fallback patterns

2. **Enhanced Door State Display**:
   - Clear Open/Closed state indication with appropriate emojis
   - Event counting display with visual counters
   - Multi-line conditional formatting for state and information

3. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Complete try/catch blocks in decodeUplink and add_web_sensor
   - Graceful degradation on parse errors
   - Door state validation with fallback handling
   - Display error protection with fallback message
   - Event counting overflow protection

4. **Global Storage Patterns**:
   - Multi-node support with node_id-based storage
   - Door state change tracking with timestamps
   - Event counting persistence across reloads
   - Battery level trend tracking (10-point history)
   - Alarm event tracking and statistics

5. **All Downlink Commands Working**:
   - TDC interval setting with 32-bit second support (60-86400s)
   - EDC mode enable/disable with SendDownlinkMap
   - Device reset and factory reset commands
   - Confirmed mode enable/disable
   - Device status request command
   - Alarm mode enable/disable with SendDownlinkMap
   - Alarm timeout configuration with minute precision (1-65535)
   - Open count clear command for maintenance
   - Parameter validation and error messages for all commands

6. **Framework Compatibility**:
   - LwSensorFormatter_cls() method chaining without += errors
   - Header integration with battery voltage display
   - Test command with comprehensive door state scenarios
   - Node management commands (stats, clear)
   - Complete door state and event analytics
```
