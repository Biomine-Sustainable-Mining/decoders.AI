### Additional Notes
Current Implementation Features (v1.0.0):

CRITICAL: Maintain these exact features in regeneration:

1. **Critical Berry Patterns (MANDATORY)**:
   - Fixed keys() iterator bug with explicit key arrays
   - Safe data recovery after lwreload
   - Global node storage with VS321_nodes
   - Multi-line UI formatting with event management
   - Try/catch error protection in add_web_sensor()

2. **Enhanced UI Display**:
   - Multi-line format: temp/humidity/status | people/light | events
   - Persistent sensor values between payloads
   - Event-only display for alarms/resets
   - Conditional line building to avoid empty lines

3. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Try/catch blocks in all critical methods
   - Graceful fallback for missing data
   - Console error logging with context
   - Safe payload parsing with bounds checking

4. **Global Storage Patterns**:
   - VS321_nodes for multi-device support
   - Data persistence across driver reloads
   - Historical data tracking for trends
   - Reset/alarm event management

5. **All Test Scenarios Working**:
   - 10 diverse scenarios covering all device states
   - Realistic payloads with proper channel structure
   - Comprehensive coverage of all channels
   - Creative scenarios beyond basic operation

6. **Framework Compatibility**:
   - Framework v2.2.9 integration
   - People formatter added to LwDecode.be
   - Standard command patterns (LwVS321TestUI)
   - Proper driver registration
